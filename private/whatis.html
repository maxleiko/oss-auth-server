<h1 id="oneshotsoftware-framework">OneShotSoftware framework</h1>

<p>This framework proposes the foundation for creating a moving target defense architecture for distributed software. This framework enables distributed to change their behavior, the component interaction, the graphical interface and their architecture configurations dynamically while preserving the requirements and integrity of services. The main goal of the <strong>oneshotsoftware</strong> framework is to hinder the adversaryâ€™s capabilities in scanning or discovering software vulnerabilities targets, launching attacks and creating botnets structure.</p>

<h2 id="oneshotsoftware-architecture">OneShotSoftware architecture</h2>

<p>The framework architecture is based on the following basis:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kevoree.org">Kevoree</a> for the architectural model and deployment management.</li>
  <li><a href="http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/">Spoon</a> for the source to source transformation engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these two foundations, we are building a set of model for capturing components interaction, components interface, components graphical interface and we are building a set of libraries to create disruption,processor to automatically inject countermeasures withing the component source code. Next we use <a href="http://www.kevoree.org">Kevoree</a> and <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> to automatically deploy the components variant for each new user.</p>
